A physics demonstration showcasing the Rapier3D physics engine integration. Features:

- Dynamic rigid bodies with realistic gravity and collisions
- Static ground plane
- Multiple bouncing cubes with random initial velocities
- Real-time physics simulation at 60 FPS
- Click to spawn new physics-enabled cubes!

This example demonstrates the `PhysicsProcessor`, `RigidBodyComponent`, and `ColliderComponent` working together.
